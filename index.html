                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p><img src="images/photo.png" alt="photo" class="alignleft">I was born and raised in Sacramento, California, so I know large areas of the city like the back of my hand. Since turning 21, I've also been able to explore the ins and outs of Downtown Sacramento and can tell you a little too much about the night life down there. </p>
				<p>Currently I have two jobs; one as a barista at a drive-thru coffee shop, and  another as a server/bartender at a sushi restaurant. Having two jobs was not my intention, but I fell in love with keeping a busy schedule, suddenly discovering a great love for naps in between my shifts. My current job hunt right now is to be a bartender somewhere in MidTown or Downtown.</p>
                <p>I have a lot of hobbies (expensive ones, unfortunately) that take up a lot of my time when I'm not at work or doing homework. Going to the gym and focusing on my overall physical health falls as my third priority after work and school, easily overlooking the 30 minute drive to my favorite gym. I also love to draw and design tattoos for myself and others, and I have designed a few different logos for an athletic wear brand. I have picked up the idea of being a jack of all trades in my love of art- painting tables for drinking games and events and painting on my furniture. I also read a lot of books and play a lot of video games, and attend too many concerts and music festivals. Needless to say, I live a very full and busy life, while still taking some time out of my weekends dedicated to my social life.</p>
